# DDD

## What this project is

A toy project for practising **Domain-Driven Design** in a single-runtime backend. Seven bounded contexts live in the same FastAPI process and communicate via in-process domain events.

## Event flow (happy path)

```
User uploads media
  → Imports emits FileIngested
    → Storage: stores the file
    → Analyzer: accepts job into its internal queue, processes (retries + batching)
      → emits TranscriptReady
        → Webhooks: fires outbound notification
        → Billing: records usage unit
```

## Bounded contexts

| Context   | Key aggregate(s)              | Key events emitted                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| IAM       | `User`, `Role`, `Policy`      | `UserCreated`, `RoleAssigned`         |
| Imports   | `ImportJob`                   | `FileIngested`                        |
| Storage   | `StoredObject`                | `ObjectStored`, `ObjectDeleted`       |
| Scheduler | `CronJob`                     | `CronFired`                           |
| Analyzer  | `AnalysisJob`, `Transcript`   | `TranscriptReady`, `TranscriptFailed` |
| Webhooks  | `WebhookEndpoint`, `Delivery` | `DeliverySucceeded`, `DeliveryFailed` |
| Billing   | `UsageRecord`, `Invoice`      | `InvoiceGenerated`                    |

## DDD conventions

- **No cross-context domain imports.** Use plain primitives (UUIDs, strings) or a thin anti-corruption layer at context boundaries.
- **Aggregates** enforce invariants via named methods — never public setters.
- **Value objects** are immutable; equality is by value.
- **Domain events** are the only cross-context coupling. Publish to an in-process event bus; each context subscribes to what it needs.
- **Repositories** are interfaces in `domain/`; implementations in `infrastructure/`.
- **API routers** translate HTTP ↔ application commands only — no business logic.

## IAM integration

Other contexts call the IAM application service to authorize actions — they never read the IAM database.

## Running

```bash
make install   # install all deps
make dev       # start backend + frontend concurrently
make format    # black + prettier
make build     # production frontend build
```

## ROADMAP

**After completing any task, update `/Users/ajean/.claude/projects/-Users-ajean-dev-DDD/ROADMAP.md`** — mark finished items `- [x]` and keep the file accurate. The ROADMAP lives outside the repo (it is in `.gitignore`).

## Subagents

When spawning agents (Explore, general-purpose, etc.) for lightweight tasks (file lookups, searches, simple edits), always pass `model: "haiku"` to minimize cost. Only use the default (Sonnet) or `model: "opus"` for tasks that genuinely need stronger reasoning.

## What to avoid

- Anemic domain models (logic in routers or application services, not aggregates)
- Direct cross-context repository or domain-object access
- Raw DB rows leaking out of repositories
- Adding HTTP calls between contexts — keep it in-process
